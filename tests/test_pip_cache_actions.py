"""Pins the pip-cache restore/save contract for every workflow.

The failure this guards is invisible at runtime. `actions/setup-python`'s
built-in `cache: 'pip'` is read-write and saves from its post-step on
WHATEVER REF the job ran on, and a cache written on a pull_request ref can
only be restored by re-runs of that same pull request. So every PR writes a
copy nobody else can ever read, which then competes for the repo's 20 GiB
budget against main's copy, which every PR CAN read.

Measured on this repo 2026-08-26: 19.97 of 20 GiB, of which merged PR #1084
alone held 6.6 GiB on refs/pull/1084/merge. Nothing failed. Over quota GitHub
deletes whole entries by last access date, so main's copy goes, the next PR
misses, downloads, and writes its own copy. CI just gets slower.

Nothing about re-adding `cache: 'pip'` looks wrong in review -- it is the
documented way to do this -- which is why it is asserted here instead.
