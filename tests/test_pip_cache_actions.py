"""Pins the pip-cache restore/save contract for every workflow.

`actions/setup-python`'s built-in `cache: 'pip'` saves from its post-step on
whatever ref the job ran on, and a cache written on a pull_request ref can only
be restored by re-runs of that same PR. So every PR writes a copy nobody else
can read, competing for the 20 GiB budget against main's copy, which every PR
can read. Measured 2026-08-26: 19.97 of 20 GiB, merged PR #1084 holding 6.6 GiB
of it. Nothing failed; CI just got slower.

Re-adding `cache: 'pip'` looks right in review -- it is the documented way to
do this -- which is why it is asserted here instead.
